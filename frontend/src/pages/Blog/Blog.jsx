    title: "Implantation Bleeding Vs Periods: Know the Difference",
    author: "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
    date: "February 28, 2025",
    content:
      "Implantation bleeding occurs when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus, usually around 10-14 days after conception. It is typically lighter and shorter than a regular period. Menstrual periods, on the other hand, involve the shedding of the uterine lining and are usually heavier and last longer. Recognizing the differences can help in early pregnancy detection and proper medical consultation.",
